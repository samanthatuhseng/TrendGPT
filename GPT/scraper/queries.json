    "explanation": "This filter captures tweets that mention the keywords 'crypto', 'cryptocurrency', 'bitcoin', 'ethereum', 'btc', 'eth', or 'blockchain' from either specific influential accounts in the crypto space or any verified accounts. The '-filter:retweets' part ensures that the query only returns original tweets and not retweets. The ':)', ':(', and '?' symbols search for tweets with positive, negative, and questioning sentiment respectively, which could provide a rough gauge of the overall sentiment towards the crypto market."
